# UnpredictableObject

type StringObject = { [key: string]: string };

export type UnpredictableObject = {
a: number;
c: any;
b?: StringObject;
};

// please create a function with returntype Array<StringObject> | null, that does the following:
// - takes a minimum of 2 parameters: one parameter is called checkObject and is of type StringObject. The other parameter is of the type UnpredictableObject. (You can assume that the UnpredictableObject
// can have 0 or 1 arrays somehwere inside of it)
// - finds any array anywhere inside the UnpredictableObject that has xyz as a key. for example, this could be the case:

const obj: UnpredictableObject = {
a: 22,
c: {
xcd: {
ddffd: {
xyz: [
{
a: 343,
c: "blabla",
d: 344,
},
],
},
},
},
};
// - if the array is not found, your function returns null
// - if the array is found, it returns a filtered version of the array. The filtered array only has objects
// that contain all key value pairs that are present inside the StringObject that was provided to your function as a first argument (parameter called checkObject)
